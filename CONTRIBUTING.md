# Contributing to GoCardless API Docs

We'd love for you to contribute to our docs! Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

## Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/gocardless/legacy-api-docs/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Make your changes in a new git branch

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

* Create your patch, including appropriate test cases.
* Commit your changes and create a descriptive commit message
* Build your changes locally to ensure it all works

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

* Push your branch to Github:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In Github, send a pull request to `api-docs:master`.
* If we suggest changes then you can modify your branch, rebase and force a new push to your GitHub
  repository to update the Pull Request:

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

When the patch is reviewed and merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

```shell
# Delete the remote branch on Github:
git push origin --delete my-fix-branch

# Check out the master branch:
git checkout master -f

# Delete the local branch:
git branch -D my-fix-branch

# Update your master with the latest upstream version:
git pull --ff upstream master
```
