`200`
:    The request has succeeded.

`404`
:    Not Found. The requested resource was not found. The response body will explain which resource was not found.

`412`
:    Precondition Failed. Certain unmet conditions must be fulfilled before the request to be processed e.g. timestamp is too old. More details in response body.

`418`
:    I'm a teapot. The webserver cannot respond as it is temporarily a teapot.

`422`
:    Unprocessable Entity. Could not process a POST request because the request is invalid. The response body will contain more details in the form of an array.
