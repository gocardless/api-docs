# Webhook overview

<p class="intro">To alert you of any changes in the status of your resources, GoCardless provides webhooks. These are POST requests to your server that are sent as soon as a resource changes status. The body of the request contains details of the change.</p>

To read more about how webhooks will fit into your application flow, please see the [GoCardless Anatomy](#gocardless-anatomy)
