<h0>.NET Library</h0>

# Notice

## This client library is no longer supported.

<p class="well-notice u-margin-Vl">
    This library isn't maintained to the same high standard as our other projects, so we would advise that you don't use it to build a new integration.
</p>

If you're working with our API using .NET, you should [make HTTP requests to our API directly](https://developer.gocardless.com) instead.

The source for this library will remain available [on Github](https://github.com/gocardless/gocardless-legacy-dotnet), so you can modify the code to suit your requirements if you still wish to use it.
