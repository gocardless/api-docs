# The Legacy GoCardless API

<p class="well-notice u-margin-Vl">
  <strong>This documentation is intended for developers who already have an integration with this API.</strong>
  If you're starting a new integration you should use our new API instead - check out the [getting started guide](https://developer.gocardless.com/getting-started) and the [API reference](https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference).
  The legacy API will not receive updates, and does not offer as many features as the new one.
