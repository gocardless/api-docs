## Contact us

Need help with your integration? We offer two forms of support for developers: IRC and email.

Please try to [catch exceptions](#exception-handling) before contacting support with any troubleshooting related issues.

### IRC
[Join our developer](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=gocardless&uio=OT10cnVlJjExPTIzNiYxMj10cnVl51) chat at `#gocardless` on `irc.freenode.net`.

### Email
Alternatively, please email us at [help@gocardless.com](mailto:help@gocardless.com).

We can provide the **most effective** support via these two channels as they allow us to see your code.
